# Advent of Code 2020

#### by Aoife Bradley

---

If you want to test it with your input, place it with your input in a file called "input" beside the executable of the day.

only tested on ubuntu 20.10

compiled with `gcc -g x.c -o ./x -msse4.2`

I tried to make each day with no leaks or memory issues.

lemme know if there are any issues with the code. :)
